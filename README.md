# Massive

A body mass index calculator written in **COBOL** and compiled with `gnucobol`.

This simple project taught me the basics of COBOL, writing and reading to the console, performing simple compute with variables, and the `gnucobol` compiler.

## Program Functions

1. Prompts the user for their height and weight.
2. Calculates the user's BMI.
3. Prints the user's BMI.
4. Outputs the user's BMI category (underweight, normal, overweight).

## Compiling and Running

1. Install `gnucobol` using your package manager.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `cobc main.cbl` in the project directory.
4. Run `./main` to run the program.

I wrote and compiled this program on a Ubuntu machine and it works fine.
